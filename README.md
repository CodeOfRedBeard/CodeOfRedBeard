- 👋 Hi, I’m @CodeOfRedBeard
- 👀 I’m interested in automation and scripting to better our lives.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R for assistance with Salesforce reporting.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... well... nothing. Too many irons in the fire.
- 📫 How to reach me: payner@opentext.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: Creating complex automation or scripting projects goes a lot better when enjoying a pipe or cigar while drinking a superb coffee beverage.
